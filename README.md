# Guardian
Guardian is the ultimate security app in your hand. Being easy to configure and the power of being tracked by buddies and security groups simultaneously, ensures multi-fold security for you. Since the app utilizes the combined power of your buddies and security agencies, you get help faster when you seek it. It also provides directions to local help such as police, hospitals and other agencies on your phone, as well as provides accurate information for your buddies to respond. With meaningful regular SMS alerts, it ensures that the coverage for the app is to-the-point and maximum. What makes Guardian unique and best in class is that it leverages a cloud based infrastructure to make sure that even if the attacker destroys the phone or the GPRS connection gets lost, the system intelligently keeps relaying SOS alerts, seeking assistance.
