                Guardian cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve
                the integrity and security of all information we collect and that we share with our service providers. However, no security system is impenetrable and we
                cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security,
                we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and
                take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.

            <div>
                The user data collected by this app e.g. locations, evidence etc. would be retained for three months and would get purged after this time. Guardian DOES
                NOT retain any such user data permanently. If a profile is deleted, all the data related to that profile would get deleted. When a user un-registers from
                Guardian, all his/her profiles and their associated data will be purged. Uninstalling the app will not purge the user data in Guardian. Upon a re-install,
                the user profile data would be loaded after user re-registers in Guardian.
